# FREYA-Eliza-Bot
 FREYA is a ChatBot based on the ELIZA bot, but in Danish!

# Usage:
 To use the bot simply open the python file and start talking!
 If you type 'quit'/'slut' at the end the bot will terminate and record the conversation to a text file 'conversation.txt' within the python directory.

# Method:
 This bot works by using simple regex string mapping. If it falls in one of the cases it will go throught the list of reflections (from 1st <-> 2nd person) and replace all matches. The bot would be used to have the user reflect on their answers questions - by giving guiding questions.
